|-------- End of Sprint 1 --------|

|--- Kayla ---|

I worked on the following tasks:
1. <Creating the Notion project board> - This task wasn't a program feature, but simply to track tasks.

2. <Update and Delete> - This was version 1 of this task. This task implemented the logic of deleting and editing reminders.  This was designed using the original database.cindy user to start.


I also needed to research the following things:
1. <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/splice> - This was just researching what would be the best function for updating and removing reminders from the array of reminders.

|-------- End of Sprint 2 --------|

|--- Kayla ---|

I worked on the following tasks:
1. <Fix Update and Delete code> - This is version 2 of the task. This purpose of this task was to adjust the update and delete functionality to accomodate the currently logged in user.

2. <Implementation of Unsplash API> 
This task required:
(a) acquiring an Unsplash API access key
(b) reviewing the Unsplash API documentation to understand how to implement the API
(c) coding a new reminder controller function in our application to check if the current user has an icon.  If yes, continue with the next action in the get request. If not, ping the Unsplash server to get an random image, then continue once successful.
(d) update to reminders layout to include the user's icon image

3. <Social Component - Displaying friend reminders>
This task required:
(a) adding friends for some users stored in the database
(b) adding a new function for getting users to the reminder controller responsible for comparing all users in the database, and desciding if they are a friend of not.
(c) implement a new page. When app.get requests the new page, call the getting users function, and render all users on the page. If friend, show reminders, if not, show a button to add a friend.

4. <Social Component - Ability to add a friend>
This task required:
(a) adding a form post method to "Other Users" listed.
(b) adding an input field with no display to submit
(c) creating the addUsers function in the reminderController file. This grabs the id of the new friend added, and pushes it into the currentUser's friend array.
(d) redirect the page so it triggers the "app.get" request, which then retriggers the getting users function.



I also needed to research on Youtube and Google the following things:
1. <Insert Video or Link to thing you needed to research>
